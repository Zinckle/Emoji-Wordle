# Emojle

Emojle is an emoji-based guessing game similar to the game wordle. it can be found at Emojle.site 

## How does it work?

The objective of the game is to use a series of guesses to determine the secret emoji of the day. Start by selecting an emoji and clicking the submit button. Then, use the results from that guess to determine a new guess that will be closer to the secret emoji.

Meanings:

✅ - Correct

❌ - Incorrect 

⬆️ - Target value is higher

⬇️ - Target value is lower

## Why did I make it?
Mostly just for fun! I thought that using emojis would be an interesting take on wordle-like games.

## Things to note
This game only includes emojis from Emoji V11.0 and earlier, does not include any flags, groups gendered emojis (like male-wizard and female-wizard) together, and the data is only from 2021 and earlier. The data comes from the website https://home.unicode.org/emoji/emoji-frequency/ provided by the unicode consortium.
